  Complaint Management Application is an Android based mini-project. The purpose of this mini-project was to enhance and implement my knowledge of Android Framework and Firebase libraries. This project was completed in the last week of the training.
	
  The application can be used to log complaints from an android device with proper authentication. All the pending complaints can be viewed from the app. The data is updated in real-time. All the complaints can be managed by the Admin from the Firebase console.
